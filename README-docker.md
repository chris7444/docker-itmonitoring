2. Technical Add-On to collect perf stats and meta data - ta-dockerstats
3. Splunk Enterprise with a docker app displaying logs and metrics collected from docker data center. 
4. Technical Add-On to format Universal Control Plane (UCP) syslog - ta-ucplogs-sysloginput

Minimum Requirements:
- Docker Runtime Engine v17.06.2

# List of Technical Add-ons
1. ta-dockerlogs_fileinput: Uses Splunk's File & Directories monitoring to monitor all files generated by the docker json-file driver.  Please read the following docker logging drivers documentation to learn more about the logging options in docker, https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/.

2. ta-dockerstats:  Uses [Docker Remote API](https://docker.github.io/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api/) to collect Inspect, Top, and Events in Splunk;  This TA is also used to correlate container ids collected by the ta-dockerlogs_fileinput.

3. ta-ucplogs-sysloginput: is used to transform the UCP syslog (TCP/UDP) data in to a ucp source that can be more efficiently analyzed in Splunk.<br>
